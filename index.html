        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a fourth year student at University of California, Riverside. I made the decision to go into the field of biology because I believe it is incredibly important to understand the world around us. I specifically have enjoyed the classes I have taken in ecology, animal behavior, and zoology. I also have enjoyed the few plant-based cell and biology classes I have taken. Aside from my classes, I have spent my time interning at a physical therapist’s office in my hometown. I was able to work hands-on with patients, learn how to properly instruct them in exercises, diagnose an issue, and use the type of equipment a doctor of physical therapy uses on a daily basis regardless of if they work in a hospital, private office, or other type of setting. This experience also gave me great insight into the world of physical therapy. I got to speak to multiple doctors of physical therapy as well as physical therapist assistants. Some of these people had also practiced in other countries, so I was able to learn about the health care system and educational process of becoming a PT in multiple other countries besides the United States of America. When I was not focusing on classes and interning, I worked in my role as Vice President of Risk Management for my on-campus organization, Alpha Chi Omega. This role gave me the platform to educate about and prevent high risk situations in the college scene, such as drug use, hazing, peer pressure, etc. This position also had me working closely with the headquarters of the enterprise known as the Alpha Chi Omega foundation, which includes a total of three businesses. Being vice president of risk management, an executive officer of my chapter, allowed me to be exposed to the inner workings of the company. I also focused on creating and hosting mental health and wellness workshops with my chapter, as well as a few interactive seminars with guest speakers about team strength and wellness. Throughout my college career, I have learned two main things about myself: I love learning about animals as well as educating and helping others to understand them and how their world related to ours. This can relate to evolution, ecology, biological medicine, etc. Eventually, I strongly desire to attend graduate school to obtain my master’s in public health, ecology, or evolutionary biology. However, I want to join the workforce for now, straight out of undergraduate school, in order to find a more specific line of work I would like focus on and to gain more invaluable work experience before entering school again. I would love to be able to stay in California for work and graduate school if possible, since California does have a little bit of so many different types of ecosystems perfect for studying different animals and ecology, but the opportunity to briefly branch out to other states or even countries would also be great exposure. I would love to see the world and explore it and its organisms.<br><br>
